## The Riddles

This is a learning journey through the foundational layers of web technology. Each riddle must be solved completely before proceeding to the next. Half-answers lead to confusion. Incomplete understanding leads to dependency.

### Riddle I: The Server
*"What is the machine that serves your pages, and how does it work?"*

- [ ] Provision a VPS from scratch
- [ ] Install and configure nginx by hand
- [ ] Understand every line in the nginx config
- [ ] Serve a static HTML page
- [ ] Configure SSL/TLS certificates manually
- [ ] Document the entire process in detail

**Proof of Understanding**: Explain to someone (or write as if explaining) how a request travels from browser to server and back.

### Riddle II: The Domain
*"What is a name in the network, and how does it resolve?"*

- [ ] Register a domain
- [ ] Configure DNS records manually
- [ ] Understand A, AAAA, CNAME, MX records
- [ ] Set up DNS propagation monitoring
- [ ] Document the entire DNS resolution process

**Proof of Understanding**: Trace a DNS lookup from your browser to the root servers and back.

### Riddle III: The Code Repository
*"Where does your code live, and who controls it?"*

- [ ] Set up self-hosted Git (Gitea/Forgejo)
- [ ] Configure user management and permissions
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Understand Git internals (objects, refs, hooks)
- [ ] Document the complete Git workflow

**Proof of Understanding**: Explain how Git stores data and what happens during a commit.

### Riddle IV: The Network
*"How do machines speak to each other across the void?"*

- [ ] Learn TCP/IP fundamentals
- [ ] Understand HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- [ ] Set up network monitoring
- [ ] Configure firewalls and security groups
- [ ] Learn about load balancing and proxies

**Proof of Understanding**: Trace a packet from your machine to the server and back.

### Riddle V: The Shell
*"What is the command line, and how does it command?"*

- [ ] Master bash scripting
- [ ] Understand process management
- [ ] Learn system administration basics
- [ ] Set up log monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Automate deployment processes

**Proof of Understanding**: Write deployment scripts that could run on any Unix system.

### Riddle VI: The Hardware
*"What is the machine beneath the abstraction?"*

- [ ] Understand CPU, memory, storage
- [ ] Learn about performance monitoring
- [ ] Study hardware limitations and constraints
- [ ] Scavenge and analyze physical components
- [ ] Document the relationship between code and silicon

**Proof of Understanding**: Explain how your code becomes electrical signals.

## The Rules

1. **No shortcuts**: Every concept must be understood from first principles
2. **No copy-paste**: Every configuration must be typed and understood
3. **No moving forward**: Complete each riddle before starting the next
4. **Document everything**: Your future self will thank you
5. **Fail correctly**: When you don't understand something, admit it and dig deeper

## The Process

Each riddle follows the same pattern:
1. **Research**: Read the manual, understand the theory
2. **Implement**: Build it by hand, understand every step
3. **Test**: Break it, fix it, understand the failure modes
4. **Document**: Write about what you learned
5. **Teach**: Explain it clearly enough that someone else could follow

## The Danger

The sphinx devours those who answer incorrectly. In this context, "incorrect" means:
- Incomplete understanding
- Cargo cult programming
- Dependency on tools you don't understand
- Pretending to know something you don't

## The Reward

Those who answer correctly gain passage to the next level of understanding. The knowledge builds upon itself. The foundation becomes unshakeable.

*Begin when you are ready to be honest about what you don't know.*
