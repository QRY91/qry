### Riddle I: The Multi-tongued Code Serpent
*"What is the primary project, once known as the 'QRY Trinity', now unified into one powerful tool for development?"*

- [ ] Identify the name of the unified project (uroboro)
- [ ] List the three components that were previously distinct but are now integrated in the new project
- [ ] Explain how the new project differs from its previous iterations

**Proof of Understanding**: Provide a concise description of the changes made to the project since it was known as "QRY Trinity", and explain why these changes were implemented.

### Riddle II: The Language Labyrinth
*"What are the programming languages used in this project, as well as the file types associated with each?"*

- [ ] List the programming languages used in the project (PHP, JavaScript, Go, JSON, TypeScript, Python, Shell, SQL)
- [ ] Identify the key files for each language (Makefile for PHP, go.mod for Go, vscode-extension/package.json for TypeScript, landing-page/package.json for JavaScript, web/package.json for both JavaScript and React)
- [ ] Explain the role of JSON and SQL in this project

**Proof of Understanding**: Demonstrate understanding by explaining how each language is utilized within the context of the project, and provide a brief overview of the role of JSON and SQL.

### Riddle III: The Rebirth of Uroboros
*"If one were to rebuild this project from scratch, which steps would be necessary to recreate its core architecture?"*

- [ ] Describe the process for setting up the project structure based on the key files provided in the README
- [ ] Explain how dependencies are managed using go.mod and package.json files
- [ ] Identify any crucial considerations when working with multi-language development

**Proof of Understanding**: Provide a step-by-step guide for rebuilding the project from scratch, detailing the specific processes for each stage, including setting up the project structure, managing dependencies, and handling multi-language development.
