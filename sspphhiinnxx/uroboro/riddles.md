# uroboro Sphinx Riddles 🐍

> **Answer correctly, or be devoured by your own ignorance of systematic work documentation.**

*These riddles test your deep understanding of the uroboro unified development assistant. Each must be mastered completely before proceeding to the next. Surface knowledge of CLI patterns leads to brittle tooling. Incomplete understanding of database design leads to data corruption.*

## Riddle I: The Trinity Unification Oracle
*"How did three separate tools become one unified intelligence, and what architectural principles governed this metamorphosis?"*

- [ ] Explain the exact integration strategy that unified wherewasi, examinator, and uroboro
- [ ] Rebuild the smart project detection logic without referencing existing code
- [ ] Implement content-based auto-tagging from first principles
- [ ] Document why "3 commands beats 17" despite absorbing three tools' functionality
- [ ] Trace the data flow from capture → intelligent tagging → context linking

**Proof of Understanding**: Design an alternative trinity unification strategy, then explain why the chosen approach was superior for maintaining simplicity while adding intelligence.

## Riddle II: The SQLite Schema Sage
*"What tables hold the essence of your work, and how do their relationships encode the developer's journey?"*

- [ ] Reconstruct the complete database schema from understanding of the workflow
- [ ] Implement all SQL queries for capture, publish, and status operations
- [ ] Design indexes that optimize the most common query patterns
- [ ] Handle database migrations and schema evolution gracefully
- [ ] Explain why SQLite instead of PostgreSQL, Redis, or plain JSON files

**Proof of Understanding**: Create a database stress test that demonstrates your schema can handle 10,000 captures with sub-100ms query performance.

---

## Riddle III: The Go Architecture Architect
*"How do the internal packages collaborate to transform raw developer thoughts into structured, publishable insights?"*

- [ ] Rebuild the package dependency graph from memory
- [ ] Implement the capture pipeline: CLI → validation → database → context detection
- [ ] Design the publish workflow: database query → AI enhancement → output generation
- [ ] Create the status aggregation: data retrieval → analytics → presentation
- [ ] Explain why this specific package structure instead of monolithic design

**Proof of Understanding**: Refactor the entire internal package structure using a different architectural pattern, then demonstrate equivalent functionality.

---

## Riddle IV: The Ollama Integration Wizard
*"How does your tool commune with local AI without surrendering user privacy or control?"*

- [ ] Implement the complete Ollama communication protocol from scratch
- [ ] Design prompt engineering for content analysis and tagging
- [ ] Handle AI service failures, timeouts, and degraded responses gracefully
- [ ] Explain the security implications of local vs. cloud AI integration
- [ ] Create fallback mechanisms when Ollama is unavailable

**Proof of Understanding**: Replace Ollama with a different local AI system (like llamafile) while maintaining identical user experience.

---

## Riddle V: The Context Detection Detective
*"What signals reveal the true nature of a development project, and how do you extract them from digital chaos?"*

- [ ] Implement project detection logic for git repos, package files, directory structures
- [ ] Create technology stack identification from file extensions and dependencies
- [ ] Design heuristics for detecting project relationships and boundaries
- [ ] Handle edge cases: nested projects, multi-language repos, legacy codebases
- [ ] Explain why certain context signals were chosen over others

**Proof of Understanding**: Build a project classifier that correctly identifies project type and tech stack for 20 diverse repositories without manual configuration.

---

## Riddle VI: The Web Journey Visualizer
*"How do you transform temporal database records into navigable visual narratives of development progress?"*

- [ ] Implement the timeline data aggregation and transformation logic
- [ ] Create the web interface that renders journey visualizations
- [ ] Design responsive layouts that work across devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Handle real-time updates as new captures are added
- [ ] Explain the trade-offs between server-side rendering and client-side interactivity

**Proof of Understanding**: Create an alternative visualization (network graph, kanban board, etc.) that provides equal insight into development patterns.

---

## Riddle VII: The CLI Command Philosopher
*"Why do exactly three commands capture the essence of all development work, and how does each embody a fundamental principle?"*

- [ ] Justify the capture/publish/status trinity from first principles
- [ ] Implement argument parsing and validation for all three commands
- [ ] Design help systems and error messages that guide rather than confuse
- [ ] Create aliases and shortcuts that enhance rather than complicate the interface
- [ ] Explain why this CLI design instead of subcommands, flags, or configuration files

**Proof of Understanding**: Design a completely different CLI interface (GUI, TUI, API) that maintains the same conceptual simplicity.

---

## Riddle VIII: The Analytics Privacy Guardian
*"How do you gather insights about tool usage without compromising user autonomy or data sovereignty?"*

- [ ] Implement PostHog analytics integration with privacy controls
- [ ] Design data collection that provides useful insights without user tracking
- [ ] Create opt-in/opt-out mechanisms that respect user preferences
- [ ] Handle analytics failures without degrading core functionality
- [ ] Explain the ethical framework governing data collection decisions

**Proof of Understanding**: Build an alternative analytics system using different privacy-preserving techniques, then compare effectiveness.

---

## Riddle IX: The Configuration Minimalist
*"How do you eliminate configuration complexity while maintaining flexibility for diverse development environments?"*

- [ ] Implement intelligent defaults that work across different setups
- [ ] Create configuration discovery that adapts to user preferences automatically
- [ ] Design override mechanisms for edge cases without bloating the interface
- [ ] Handle missing dependencies and incomplete environments gracefully
- [ ] Explain why minimal configuration aligns with the tool's philosophy

**Proof of Understanding**: Demonstrate your tool working identically on macOS, Linux, and Windows without any user configuration.

---

## Riddle X: The Build System Master
*"What does your Makefile reveal about the development process, and how do its targets encode testing philosophy?"*

- [ ] Implement the complete CI pipeline from the Makefile targets
- [ ] Create unit tests that verify core functionality without external dependencies
- [ ] Design integration tests that validate real-world usage scenarios
- [ ] Build release automation that produces consistent, deployable artifacts
- [ ] Explain why Make instead of modern task runners or scripts

**Proof of Understanding**: Convert the entire build system to a different tool (just, task, npm scripts) while maintaining identical functionality and development experience.

---

## The Master Challenge

### Riddle XI: The Complete Reconstruction
*"Can you rebuild uroboro from nothing but architectural understanding, creating a tool that captures work with equal intelligence?"*

- [ ] Implement the three core commands with identical user experience
- [ ] Create the database schema that supports the same query patterns
- [ ] Build AI integration that provides equivalent content analysis
- [ ] Design the web interface with matching visualization capabilities
- [ ] Prove your implementation handles the same edge cases and failure modes

**Proof of Understanding**: Process identical development scenarios through both the original uroboro and your reconstruction, demonstrating equivalent output and behavior.

## The Rules of Understanding

1. **No code copying**: Every implementation must emerge from architectural comprehension
2. **No feature shortcuts**: Each capability must be rebuilt from fundamental understanding
3. **No moving forward**: Master each riddle completely before advancing
4. **Document relentlessly**: Your future self will judge your explanations
5. **Fail constructively**: When you encounter ignorance, dig deeper rather than guess

## The Sphinx's Challenge

*Those who answer with incomplete understanding will build tools that break under real-world usage. Those who proceed without mastering the fundamentals will create software that serves the machine rather than the human.*

**The trinity of capture, publish, status seems simple—but do you understand why it works?**
