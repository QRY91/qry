### Riddle I: The Heartbeat of the Project
*"What keeps this project alive, without it, nothing moves forward?"*

- Identify the main script or entry point of the Sphinx Generator.
- Find out how the project is being executed and what triggers its execution.
- Investigate the role of the main function in initiating the codebase's operations.

**Proof of Understanding**: Rebuild the project from scratch by setting up the necessary dependencies, recreating the entry point, and executing the main function.

### Riddle II: The Pillars of Knowledge
*"What are the building blocks that provide structure to the sphinx's wisdom?"*

- Locate the core modules in the Sphinx Generator that contain essential functions or classes.
- Determine the role of each identified module within the overall project architecture.
- Investigate how these core modules interact with one another and contribute to the project's functionality.

**Proof of Understanding**: Rebuild a simplified version of the Sphinx Generator, focusing on the core modules and their interactions.

### Riddle III: The Dependency Dance
*"What external helpers does the sphinx rely upon for its powers?"*

- Identify the dependencies listed in the project's `requirements.txt` file.
- Research each dependency to understand its purpose in the Sphinx Generator.
- Determine how these dependencies are integrated into the project and how they impact its functionality.

**Proof of Understanding**: Rebuild the Sphinx Generator from scratch, ensuring that all dependencies are correctly installed and properly utilized throughout the codebase.
