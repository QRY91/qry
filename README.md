# QRY: Square Peg. Round Hole.

*A microstudio for building tools that teach you to build better tools*

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**We don't just solve problems - we understand the humans who have them.**

QRY Labs creates better systems instead of conforming to broken ones. Through psychology-informed design, local-first privacy architecture, and systematic methodology, we build tools that empower rather than surveil, teach rather than extract, and respect human autonomy while providing genuine intelligence.

## 🏗️ Ecosystem Architecture

This workspace is organized by domain alignment, reflecting our web strategy and development priorities:

### 🌐 zone/ → qry.zone
*Main hub and ecosystem navigation*
- Master brand coordination
- About QRY and philosophy
- Cross-domain navigation

### 🔬 labs/ → labs.qry.zone
*Developer tools and systematic methodology*
- **projects/**: Core trinity (wherewasi, uroboro, examinator, doggowoof, qomoboro)
- **roadmap/**: Strategic planning and project management
- **docs/**: Ecosystem documentation
- **tools/**: Shared development utilities

### 🎮 arcade/ → arcade.qry.zone
*Educational games and playful learning*
- **projects/**: Quantum Dice, educational prototypes
- Learning-through-play methodologies
- Complex concept translation frameworks

### 🛠️ tools/ → tools.qry.zone
*Utilities and experimental projects*
- **projects/**: miqro, osmotic, specialized tools
- Accessibility-focused applications
- Research prototypes

### 🏢 enterprise/
*Premium domain projects*
- **panopticron/**: Enterprise monitoring platform (panopticron.com/.io/.dev)
- **doggowoof/**: Enthusiastic monitoring (doggowoof.dog)
- Business-focused professional solutions

### 📁 other_projects/
*Non-QRY development work*
- Client projects
- Personal experiments
- Separate scope from ecosystem

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Strategic Planning
```bash
cd labs/roadmap/
# Complete strategic documentation and project profiles
```

### For Development
```bash
cd labs/projects/[project_name]/
# Individual project development
```

### For Ecosystem Intelligence
```bash
cd labs/
# Full ecosystem context for AI tools and cross-project work
```

## 🎮 The Trinity Framework

**Scout → Scribe → Scholar** workflow for systematic development intelligence:

- **🔍 Scout** (wherewasi): Context and environmental awareness
- **✍️ Scribe** (uroboro): Professional communication intelligence
- **🎓 Scholar** (examinator): Analysis and knowledge curation
- **🚨 Monitor** (doggowoof): Pattern intelligence and alert companion
- **⏰ Timer** (qomoboro): Flow optimization and temporal awareness

## 📋 Current Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation (Active)
- **uroboro**: Professional communication MVP
- **doggowoof**: Pattern intelligence with enthusiasm
- **wherewasi**: Shadow mode context tracking
- **Workspace optimization**: Domain-aligned development

### Phase 2: Intelligence Integration (Next)
- **Cross-tool communication**: Shadow mode IPC
- **Ecosystem AI**: Emergent intelligence from tool interaction
- **Educational frameworks**: Methodology validation and transfer
- **Professional features**: Team collaboration and business value

## 🌟 What Makes QRY Different

### **Local-First Privacy**
Complete data sovereignty - your intelligence stays under your control

### **Psychology-Informed Design**
Working WITH human psychology, not against it

### **Anti-Surveillance Technology**
Tools that empower rather than monitor

### **Systematic Methodology**
Transferable frameworks for building better tools

### **Square Hole Creation**
Alternatives to conforming to broken systems
