# QRY: Square Peg. Round Hole.

*Experiments in systematic tool building - converting problems into useful software*

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**Build better systems instead of conforming to broken ones.**

QRY is a personal methodology for converting institutional dysfunction into useful tools. Through systematic documentation, local-first privacy, and AI-enhanced communication, I'm learning to build software that solves real problems while figuring out how to communicate technical work effectively.

## 🏗️ Ecosystem Architecture

This workspace is organized by domain alignment, reflecting my learning process and development experiments:

### 🌐 zone/ → qry.zone
*Documentation hub and project navigation*
- About QRY methodology and current experiments
- Cross-project navigation and context

### 🔬 labs/ → labs.qry.zone  
*Developer tools and systematic experiments*
- **projects/**: Tools I'm building (wherewasi, uroboro, examinator, doggowoof, qomoboro)
- **roadmap/**: Strategic documentation and learning process
- **docs/**: Methodology documentation and insights
- **tools/**: Shared development utilities

### 🎮 arcade/ → arcade.qry.zone
*Educational games and learning experiments*
- **projects/**: Quantum Dice and other educational prototypes
- Experimenting with learning-through-play approaches
- Testing complex concept translation methods

### 🛠️ tools/ → tools.qry.zone
*Utilities and experimental projects*
- **projects/**: miqro, osmotic, specialized tools
- Accessibility-focused applications
- Research prototypes

### 🏢 enterprise/
*Production-grade projects*
- **panopticron/**: Enterprise monitoring system (internship project)
- **doggowoof/**: Local alert intelligence (personal tool)
- Projects that demonstrate technical capability

### 📁 other_projects/

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Strategic Planning
```bash
cd labs/roadmap/
# Complete strategic documentation and project profiles
```

### For Development
```bash
cd labs/projects/[project_name]/
# Individual project development
```

### For AI Collaboration
```bash
cd ai/
# Complete framework for transparent, systematic AI partnership
```

### For Ecosystem Intelligence
```bash
cd labs/
# Full ecosystem context for AI tools and cross-project work
```

## 🔄 The Tool Experiments

**Building tools that solve my own problems first:**

- **🔍 wherewasi**: Context generation for AI collaboration
- **✍️ uroboro**: Converting work into shareable content  
- **🎓 examinator**: Offline study companion with spaced repetition
- **🚨 doggowoof**: Local alert intelligence that actually works
- **⏰ qomoboro**: Simple pomodoro timer with ecosystem awareness

## 📋 Current Focus

### What I'm Building Now
- **uroboro**: Making my dev work visible and shareable
- **doggowoof**: Local alert system that doesn't drive me crazy
- **wherewasi**: Better context switching for AI collaboration
- **Documentation**: Learning to communicate what I build

### What I'm Figuring Out
- How to present technical work authentically
- Systematic approaches to tool development
- AI collaboration for better documentation
- Building useful things instead of impressive-sounding things

## 🌟 What I'm Learning

### **Local-First Approach**
Keep your data under your control, work offline when needed

### **Human-Centered Design**  
Build tools that work with how people actually think

### **Honest Communication**
Document what you're actually building, not what sounds impressive

### **Systematic Thinking**
Convert problems into reusable approaches

### **Alternative Solutions**
Build better tools instead of conforming to broken ones

## 🤝 Contributing

QRY follows systematic principles of honest development and human-centered design. The goal is building useful tools and sharing what works, not creating impressive-sounding projects.

See individual project directories for specific contribution guidelines.
