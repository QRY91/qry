## Post Content

**1:37 AM update: just finished something interesting.**

Spent the last few weeks systematically transforming 5+ years of development notes into structured frameworks. AI collaboration + human oversight = 27 articles ready for the editing pipeline.

But here's the thing - I'm starting with the two that show the process honestly: how the site was built (spoiler: AI wrote most of the words) and where AI screwed up (documented transparently in an errata page).

**Got this coming up**: CLI-first development workflows, homelab infrastructure strategy, AI collaboration methodology, plus a bunch of other systematic thinking stuff. Let me know if I should prio one over the others!

The raw articles exist. The editing happens in public. The flaws get documented and fixed as we go.

If you're into that kind of transparent building process, stick around. This should be interesting.

**Who's up building stuff at unreasonable hours?** ðŸŒ™
