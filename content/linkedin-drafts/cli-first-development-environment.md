Been running a CLI-first development environment for the past year. Some interesting observations.

Most productive setup I've built - everything from project initialization to deployment happens through composable commands. 16GB laptop consistently outperforms colleagues' 32GB machines running Docker Desktop and heavy IDEs.

The systematic approach emerged from documenting what actually slowed me down: context switching between different interfaces, waiting for tools to load, and the general unpredictability of GUI-heavy workflows.

Terminal multiplexing + vim + CLI debugging tools solved most of the friction. The surprising part was how much faster iteration became when everything stays in the same interface.

Documented the complete approach as part of my systematic problem-solving work: [link to CLI-First article]

Curious about others' experiences with CLI-focused workflows - especially anyone who's measured the productivity differences quantitatively.
