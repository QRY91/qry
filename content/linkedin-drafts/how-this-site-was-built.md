## Post Content

Spent the last few months building QRY.zone with extensive AI collaboration. Decided to document the entire process transparently instead of hiding the AI involvement.

Interesting outcome: the systematic documentation of AI collaboration became more valuable than trying to present everything as purely human work. Complete transparency about which sections involved AI assistance, what the human contributions were, and how the collaboration actually functioned.

Most people seem to be either completely hiding AI usage or overstating its capabilities. Found a middle path that treats AI as a sophisticated tool while maintaining clear human accountability for decisions and quality.

The methodology that emerged handles context preservation, decision documentation, and quality assurance in a way that scales with project complexity. Been applying it to other technical work with good results.

Curious about others' approaches to AI collaboration transparency - especially in professional contexts where accountability matters.
