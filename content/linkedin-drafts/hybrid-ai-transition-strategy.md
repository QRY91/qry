Been implementing AI tools systematically across development work for the past several months. Some patterns emerged around what actually works in practice.

Most organizations seem to swing between "ban all AI" and "AI will do everything" - both approaches create problems. Found more success with a hybrid strategy that treats AI as augmentation rather than replacement.

The systematic approach involved documenting which tasks benefit from AI assistance, which require human judgment, and how to maintain quality control throughout. Transparency about AI usage became crucial for accountability and continuous improvement.

Measured productivity gains in specific areas: documentation generation, code review assistance, and research synthesis. Also measured where AI consistently underperformed: architectural decisions, debugging complex system interactions, and anything requiring domain-specific context.

The framework that developed handles team adoption, quality assurance, and skill development in a way that adapts to different organizational contexts.

Interested in hearing about others' experiences with systematic AI adoption - especially approaches that balance productivity gains with quality control.
