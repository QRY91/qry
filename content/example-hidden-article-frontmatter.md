# CLI Tooling Stack Design

**Status**: Draft - systematic framework for composable command-line development environments

*This article demonstrates our transparent AI collaboration methodology - you're seeing this because you found the source code. The final version will be published after human review and editing.*

- Plugin management and version control
- Cross-machine consistency
