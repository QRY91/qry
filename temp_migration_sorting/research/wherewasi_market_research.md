- Opportunity: Sensitive enterprise codebases need local processing
- Wherewasi advantage: SQLite-based local storage, no cloud dependencies

### 4. **Activity-Aware Context**
- Gap: Static context generation doesn't consider recent work or hot paths
- Opportunity: Time-aware context that prioritizes recent activity
- Wherewasi advantage: Git activity tracking, recent file intelligence

### 5. **Ecosystem Relationship Mapping**
- Gap: No tools understand how projects relate to each other
- Opportunity: Large organizations have interconnected project ecosystems
- Wherewasi advantage: Cross-project dependency and relationship detection
