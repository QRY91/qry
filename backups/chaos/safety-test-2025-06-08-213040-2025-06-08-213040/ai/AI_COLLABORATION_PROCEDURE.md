# AI Collaboration Procedure: Systematic Human-AI Development

**Purpose**: Systematic procedure for transparent, documented AI collaboration in QRY development  
**Inspired By**: Cloudflare's Claude-generated OAuth library methodology  
**Integration**: Extends existing QRY AI collaboration with archaeological documentation  
**Last Updated**: June 8, 2025

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**AI collaboration should be transparent, systematic, and create archaeological records of human-AI intelligence working together.**

Building on QRY's "Honest AI Collaboration Approach," this procedure makes AI assistance a documented, transferable methodology rather than hidden magic.

---

## 📋 Pre-Collaboration Setup

### **Session Initialization**
- [ ] Update `TIMEKEEPING.md` with current date/time
- [ ] Read relevant project profile for context
- [ ] Identify specific AI collaboration goals for session
- [ ] Prepare context artifacts (code samples, documentation, requirements)

### **Tool-Specific Context**
- **uroboro**: Focus on communication intelligence and content generation
- **wherewasi**: Focus on context preservation and archaeological documentation  
- **doggowoof**: Focus on alert intelligence and user experience patterns
- **General Development**: Focus on systematic implementation and documentation

---

## 🔄 Active Collaboration Workflow

### **1. Context Establishment**
**Human Action**: Provide comprehensive context in initial prompt
```
Context Pattern:
- Current state: "Here's what we have..."
- Goal: "Here's what we want to achieve..."
- Constraints: "Here's what we need to consider..."
- QRY Principles: "This should align with [local-first/psychology-informed/etc.]"
```

**Documentation**: Save context prompt in session notes for later commit references

### **2. Prompt-by-Example Approach**
**Technique**: Show the AI exactly how the result should look/behave
- For code: Include usage examples, not just specifications
- For documentation: Show the style and structure you want
- For analysis: Provide example of the depth and format expected

**AI Response**: Systematic implementation following demonstrated patterns

### **3. Multi-Shot Refinement**
**Pattern**: "You did X, but we should do Y. Please fix."
- Clear context about current state
- Specific explanation of needed changes  
- Direct instruction for next iteration
- Reference to QRY principles when relevant

**Documentation**: Track refinement prompts for archaeological record

### **4. Quality Verification**
**Human Oversight**: Check for
- [ ] Alignment with QRY methodology and principles
- [ ] Local-first privacy preservation
- [ ] Psychology-informed design considerations
- [ ] Integration with ecosystem intelligence

**Manual Intervention**: When AI struggles, step in directly
- Styling and cleanup tasks
- Complex refactoring that AI can't handle
- Domain-specific logic that requires human judgment

## 📝 Commit Documentation Protocol

### **Commit Message Structure**
```
[COMPONENT] Brief description of change

AI Collaboration: [LEVEL]
Prompt: [ESSENTIAL PROMPT CONTENT]

Human Oversight: [HUMAN CONTRIBUTIONS]
QRY Alignment: [METHODOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS]
```

### **AI Collaboration Levels**
- **AI-Generated**: >90% AI implementation with human prompting
- **AI-Assisted**: ~70% AI with significant human refinement  
- **AI-Enhanced**: ~50% AI helping with human-led development
- **Human-Led**: <30% AI assistance, primarily for documentation/formatting

### **Example Commit Messages**

```
[uroboro] Implement sentiment analysis for developer communication

AI Collaboration: AI-Generated
Prompt: "Create a sentiment analysis module that processes developer 
communication patterns, focuses on local-first privacy, and integrates 
with shadow mode ecosystem intelligence. Use this usage example: [code]"

Human Oversight: Modified privacy handling, added QRY ecosystem integration
QRY Alignment: Local-first processing, psychology-informed design patterns
```

```
[wherewasi] Add context preservation across AI sessions

AI Collaboration: AI-Assisted  
Prompt: "You created basic context saving, but we need archaeological 
record preservation that includes prompt history and session continuity. 
Please enhance the existing system."

Human Oversight: Designed context schema, strategic integration decisions
QRY Alignment: Systematic documentation, transferable methodology
```

## 🎯 Marketing Honesty & Overhype Prevention

### **The Overhype Problem**

**Issue**: AI assistants have inherent bias toward serving users with enthusiastic, hyperbolic language ("revolutionary," "breakthrough," "exponential growth"). This conflicts with QRY's marketing honesty northstar and "underpromise, overdeliver" philosophy.

**Consequence**: When eyes are on our work, overselling destroys credibility and violates authentic expertise principles.

### **Honest Language Guidelines**

**❌ Avoid These Patterns**:
- "Revolutionary breakthrough technology"
- "Exponential intelligence amplification" 
- "Game-changing innovation"
- "Unprecedented capabilities"
- "Breakthrough AI learning"

**✅ Use These Alternatives**:
- "Working prototype with [specific capabilities]"
- "Systematic improvement in [measurable outcome]"
- "Tool that does [concrete function]"
- "Early-stage development of [specific feature]"
- "File monitoring with methodology reminders"

### **Reality Check Questions**

Before any technical claims, ask:
- [ ] **Can this be demonstrated right now?** (Not theoretical potential)
- [ ] **Would this claim survive skeptical technical review?** 
- [ ] **Is this language I'd use in a job interview?** (Professional honesty test)
- [ ] **Does this respect that 'QRY is still just me (QRY91)'?** (Market reality check)

### **Assessment Language Standards**

**For Tools**:
- State what they actually do, not what they could become
- Include limitations and known issues
- Use confidence levels for uncertain capabilities
- Distinguish between working features and experimental code

**For Results**:
- Provide specific, measurable outcomes
- Include context about testing methodology
- Acknowledge when results are preliminary
- Document systematic assessment approaches

**For Future Plans**:
- Use "planned," "intended," or "exploring" rather than definitive claims
- Focus on systematic development approach over outcome promises
- Maintain realistic timelines based on actual capacity
- Preserve strategic flexibility through honest uncertainty

### **Systematic Honesty Protocol**

1. **Draft with enthusiasm** (AI natural state)
2. **Review for hyperbole** (human oversight)
3. **Replace superlatives with specifics** (systematic editing)
4. **Test claims against reality** (empirical validation)
5. **Preserve authentic excitement** (genuine discovery vs artificial hype)

**Goal**: Maintain genuine excitement about systematic progress while avoiding credibility-destroying oversell.
