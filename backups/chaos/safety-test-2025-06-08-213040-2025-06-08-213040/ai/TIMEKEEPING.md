## Purpose

This document provides current date and time context for AI assistants working within the QRY ecosystem. It should be updated at the start of each AI collaboration session to ensure accurate temporal references in documentation and strategic planning.

## Usage for AI Assistants

When referencing dates in documentation:
- Use "June 2025" or "Q2 2025" for current period references
- Update "Last Updated" fields with current date
- Reference this document for temporal context in strategic planning
- Avoid outdated references like "January 2025" when it's clearly later

## Update Protocol

**Human Responsibility**: Update this file at start of each significant AI session  
**AI Responsibility**: Reference this file for all temporal context  
**Automation Potential**: Future qomoboro integration could automate this

## Integration with QRY Ecosystem

This timekeeping approach supports:
- **Accurate documentation**: Strategic documents reflect actual development timeline
- **Professional credibility**: Timestamps show active, current development
- **Systematic methodology**: Even time tracking follows QRY systematic principles
- **AI collaboration transparency**: Clear temporal context for all AI-assisted work

**Next Update**: Start of next AI collaboration session  
**Automation Goal**: qomoboro shadow mode time tracking for seamless AI context
