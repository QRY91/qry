# AI Collaboration Benchmarking Procedure

**Purpose**: Standardized methodology for measuring AI collaboration context restoration efficiency  
**Target**: Consistent benchmarking across different AI sessions for wherewasi development research  
**Usage**: Follow this procedure exactly to generate comparable benchmark data

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Benchmarking Overview

### **What We're Measuring**
Context restoration efficiency of AI collaboration sessions, specifically:
- **Tool call efficiency**: How many operations needed for complete context
- **Information processing**: Volume and compression ratios  
- **Time performance**: End-to-end context restoration duration
- **Accuracy metrics**: Current state recognition and priority identification
- **Resource utilization**: Token usage and computational efficiency

### **Why This Matters**
- **wherewasi development**: Baseline data for measuring context restoration improvements
- **Methodology validation**: Proof that systematic AI collaboration approaches work
- **Community value**: Transferable framework for measuring AI collaboration effectiveness
- **Continuous improvement**: Data-driven optimization of QRY systematic procedures

## ðŸ“‹ Benchmarking Procedure

### **Phase 1: Pre-Benchmark Setup**

#### **1.1 Initialize Benchmark Session**
```bash
# Get current timestamp
date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"

# Create benchmark ID
# Format: CRB-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN (Context Restoration Benchmark)
# Example: CRB-2025-06-08-001
```

#### **1.2 Document Starting Context**
- Record what AI assistant knows before beginning
- Note any prior context or session continuity
- Identify session type (morning_startup, mid_session, project_switch, etc.)

### **Phase 2: Context Restoration Process**

#### **2.1 Start Timer & Tool Call Tracking**
```
Start time: [TIMESTAMP]
Tool calls: 0
Information gathering calls: 0
Output generation calls: 0
```

#### **2.2 Follow Standard QRY AI Orientation**
Execute systematic context restoration following standard procedures:

1. **Initial Orientation**
   - `list_directory(qry)` - Root structure
   - `list_directory(qry/ai)` - AI infrastructure
   - `read_file(qry/ai/README.md)` - AI collaboration framework
   - `read_file(qry/ai/CONTEXT_BRIEFING.md)` - Ecosystem overview
   - Additional orientation files as needed

2. **Current Context Sync**
   - `read_file(qry/ai/TIMEKEEPING.md)` - Temporal context
   - `edit_file(qry/ai/TIMEKEEPING.md)` - Update time if needed

3. **Project Status Discovery**
   - `find_path` operations for project discovery
   - `read_file` operations for project status
   - `grep` operations for cross-project analysis
   - Continue until complete ecosystem understanding achieved

4. **Output Generation**
   - Generate comprehensive context summary/digest
   - Save benchmark data and analysis

#### **2.3 Track All Metrics During Process**
**For Each Tool Call**:
- Call number and type
- Purpose and expected outcome
- Information volume processed (word count)
- Key insights discovered
- Processing time estimate

**Continuous Tracking**:
- Total words read/processed
- Cross-references identified
- Projects analyzed
- Integration opportunities discovered

### **Phase 3: Data Collection & Analysis**

#### **3.1 Calculate Core Metrics**

**Tool Call Metrics**:
- `tool_calls_total` = All tool invocations
- `tool_calls_info_gathering` = Discovery and reading operations
- `tool_calls_output` = Generation and saving operations

**Information Processing Metrics**:
- `words_processed` = Total words read from all sources
- `words_generated` = Output content word count
- `compression_ratio_percent` = (words_generated / words_processed) * 100

**Performance Metrics**:
- `processing_time_minutes` = End-to-end session duration
- `context_accuracy_percent` = Subjective assessment of current state recognition
- `projects_analyzed` = Number of major projects examined
- `cross_references_found` = Integration points identified

**Resource Estimates**:
- `estimated_input_tokens` = words_processed * 1.3 (rough token conversion)
- `estimated_output_tokens` = words_generated * 1.3
- `total_estimated_tokens` = input + output tokens

**Efficiency Ratios**:
- `words_per_tool_call` = words_processed / tool_calls_total
- `manual_equivalent_minutes` = Estimated time for human-only equivalent
- `time_efficiency_ratio` = manual_equivalent_minutes / processing_time_minutes

#### **3.2 Generate Benchmark Files**

**3.2a Create Detailed Analysis File**
```
Filename: resource-usage-analysis-YYYY-MM-DD-session-type.md
Location: qry/ai/research/
Content: Complete tool call analysis, metrics, and implications
```

**3.2b Create Context Summary/Digest**
```
Filename: [session-type]-digest-YYYY-MM-DD-context-restoration-benchmark.md
Location: qry/ai/research/
Content: Generated context summary with benchmark data embedded
```

**3.2c Update CSV Metrics**
```
Filename: benchmark-metrics-YYYY-MM-DD.csv
Location: qry/ai/research/
Format: Append new row with all calculated metrics
```

#### **3.3 Capture with uroboro**
```bash
cd qry && cd labs/projects/uroboro

./uroboro capture --db "[Brief description of benchmark session and key findings]" --tags "benchmarking,context-restoration,ai-collaboration,research,systematic-methodology,[additional-tags]"
```

**Capture Message Template**:
```
"Conducted [session_type] context restoration benchmark - established [baseline/comparison] metrics: [tool_calls_total] tool calls, ~[processing_time_minutes]min processing, [words_processed/1000]K words â†’ [words_generated/1000]K output ([compression_ratio_percent]% compression), [context_accuracy_percent]% accuracy. [Key findings or implications]."
```
