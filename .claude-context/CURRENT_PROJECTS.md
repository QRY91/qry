# Embedded Game Development Learning

A systematic approach to learning embedded development through educational games and developer tools on constrained hardware.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This project documents my journey from software development to embedded systems, focusing on:

- **Educational game mechanics** optimized for constrained hardware environments
- **Developer productivity tools** that work in offline-first, resource-limited contexts
