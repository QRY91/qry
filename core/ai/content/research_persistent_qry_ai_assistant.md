## üß† The Revolutionary Concept

**"What if I could skip the context because the local AI assistant lives in the computer anyway?"**

**Core Insight**: Instead of AI assistants that need context restoration, create persistent QRY AI that **continuously inhabits your computing environment** - aware of your work patterns, project states, methodology preferences, and creative rhythms without ever needing to "catch up."

**The paradigm shift**: From "AI tool you invoke" to "AI methodology that lives alongside you" - QRY principles embedded in persistent intelligence that grows with your work and learns your systematic approaches.
