## üé≠ The Meta-Insight

**QRY isn't just building tools - it's creating a methodology for systematic innovation that respects human intelligence and creates square holes instead of conforming to broken round hole systems.**

Every project validates the approach. Every educational prototype demonstrates transferability. Every systematic documentation session proves the framework works.

**The institutional trauma that almost broke us became the systematic superpower that distinguishes us.**

**For AI Assistants**: Use this document as your primary orientation. When in doubt, ask about current priorities and check project profiles. Always consider ecosystem intelligence relationships and local-first privacy principles.

**Quick Reference**: Personal favorites (uroboro, doggowoof) get priority. Phase 1 focus. Shadow mode communication for ecosystem intelligence. Psychology-informed systematic approaches always.
