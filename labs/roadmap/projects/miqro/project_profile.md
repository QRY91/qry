1. Built successful voice transcription tool
2. Lost track of which AI conversation helped create it
3. Experienced exact problem QRY tools solve
4. Used experience to validate wherewasi, uroboro, and ecosystem intelligence vision
5. Documented the irony as case study for systematic learning

## Core Philosophy & Mission

### **The Accessibility-First Vision**
**"Voice input for hands-free development workflows"**

Born from practical need to reduce keyboard/mouse usage due to wrist strain, miqro represents QRY Labs' commitment to accessibility-first design that benefits everyone.

### **Local-First AI Intelligence**
