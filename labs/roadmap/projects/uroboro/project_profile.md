---

*"Help developers get acknowledged for their actual work"*

## Project Status: MATURE & BATTLE-TESTED

### **Current State: Production Ready**
- **Go CLI**: Fast, tested, complete 3-command workflow
- **VSCode Extension**: Integrated development experience
- **Landing Page**: Professional presentation and demos
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing and quality gates
- **Blue Ocean Positioning**: No direct competitors identified

### **The Great Cleanup Victory**
**Before**: 17 commands, 1,558 lines of bloated complexity  
**After**: 3 core commands, focused on acknowledgment pipeline  
**Result**: Tool that actually gets used because it respects developer workflow

## Core Philosophy & North Star

### **The One Problem We Solve**
Transform development insights into professional content that gets developers noticed, opportunities, and recognition.

### **Sacred Workflow (Never Touch)**
```bash
# 1. Capture (10 seconds)
uro capture "Fixed database timeout - cut query time from 3s to 200ms"

# 2. Generate (2 minutes)  
uro publish --blog

# 3. Share & Get Acknowledged
# ‚Üí Professional blog post ready to publish
```

### **Focus Guardrails (Anti-Scope-Creep)**
**‚úÖ Always Yes**: Capture real work, generate professional content, make it effortless  
**üö´ Always No**: AI coaching, productivity analytics, gamification, team features (until v2.0+)

## Technical Architecture Excellence

### **Go CLI Design**
**Core Binaries**: `uroboro` (full) + `uro` (shorthand) - same functionality, different length
```
Performance Standards:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Sub-second startup time
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Zero external dependencies (beyond Ollama)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Comprehensive unit test coverage
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cross-platform compatibility
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Professional-grade error handling
```

### **Local-First Privacy Architecture**
```
Data Flow:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ File Storage (default): Daily markdown in ~/.local/share/uroboro/daily/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database Storage (opt-in): SQLite for cross-tool communication
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Local AI Processing: Ollama integration, no cloud dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Export & Control: Full data ownership and portability
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Zero Telemetry: No phone home, no analytics
```

### **Quality Assurance Standards**
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated testing on every push/PR
- **Unit Tests**: All 3 core commands covered
- **Integration Tests**: XDG compliance verification
- **Build Verification**: Both binaries tested
- **Coverage Gates**: Prevent quality regressions

## Core Capabilities & Features

### **Command 1: `uroboro capture` / `uro capture`**
**Purpose**: Lightning-fast insight logging during development

**Working Features**:
- 10-second workflow with zero flow state interruption
- File storage (default) or database storage (opt-in with `--db`)
- Auto-git integration when wanted, not forced
- Project organization with `--project` flag
- Cross-tool communication via SQLite databases

**Usage Patterns**:
```bash
# Basic capture
uro capture "Implemented OAuth2 with JWT tokens"

# With project context
uro capture "Reduced bundle size by 40%" --project frontend

# Database storage for ecosystem intelligence
uro capture --db "Fixed auth timeout" --project backend
```

### **Command 2: `uroboro publish` / `uro publish`**
**Purpose**: Transform captures into professional content

**Content Generation**:
- **Blog posts** from development work
- **Dev logs** for technical documentation
- **Social content** for professional sharing
- **Voice matching** to sound like the developer
- **Format support**: Markdown, HTML, plain text

**Quality Standards**:
- Reads like skilled technical writer, not AI
- Specific problems & solutions, not generic advice
- Authentic developer voice, not marketing speak
- Immediately publishable with minimal editing

### **Command 3: `uroboro status` / `uro status`**
**Purpose**: Complete overview of development pipeline

**Dashboard Information**:
- Recent captures across all projects
- Git integration status
- Content generation history
- Usage analytics (local only)
- System health and configuration

## The Self-Aware Meta-Success

### **Uroboro Documents Itself**
**Perfect Meta-Example**: This project profile was generated using insights from analyzing uroboro's own codebase and documentation - the tool working as designed.

### **Living Proof of Concept**
- **Authentic Voice**: Real personality from actual developer, not corporate marketing
- **Honest Assessment**: Self-aware about both strengths and limitations
- **Practical Focus**: "I solve practical problems" over theoretical frameworks
- **Quality Obsession**: Professional standards with indie developer authenticity

## The Engineer's Standard Applied

### **"Use a Gun. If That Don't Work, Use More Gun."**
- **Practical over philosophical**: Tool that works, not theories about tools
- **More gun principle**: Improve core features instead of adding new complexity
- **Ship working solutions**: Real impact for developer recognition over impressive demos

### **Drunk User Test Philosophy**
If someone slightly impaired can't use uroboro successfully in under 2 minutes, it's too complex. Three commands pass this test consistently.
