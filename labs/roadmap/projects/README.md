*"Building tools that teach you to build better tools"*

## Project Ecosystem Overview

The QRY Labs project portfolio forms an **emergent local developer AI system** through the systematic integration of individual tools. Each project serves a specific intelligence function while contributing to unified ecosystem intelligence.

### The Trinity Framework

**Core Philosophy**: Scout ‚Üí Scribe ‚Üí Scholar workflow for systematic development intelligence

```
üîç Scout (wherewasi) ‚Üí Gathers context and environmental awareness
‚úçÔ∏è Scribe (uroboro) ‚Üí Transforms activity into professional communication  
üéì Scholar (examinator) ‚Üí Analyzes patterns and curates knowledge
üö® Monitor (doggowoof) ‚Üí Pattern intelligence and alert companion
‚è∞ Timer (qomoboro) ‚Üí Temporal awareness and flow optimization
```

### Ecosystem Intelligence Matrix

| Project | Role | Input | Output | Shadow Mode |
|---------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| **wherewasi** | Context Intelligence | File paths, git state, project switching | Development context for AI/tools | Location tracking |
| **uroboro** | Communication Intelligence | Development activity, insights | Professional summaries, documentation | Sentiment capture |
| **examinator** | Meta Intelligence | Cross-tool data, patterns | Analysis, learning insights | Knowledge curation |
| **doggowoof** | Pattern Intelligence | Webhooks, alerts, system events | Filtered notifications, celebrations | Monitoring daemon |
| **qomoboro** | Temporal Intelligence | Work sessions, timing patterns | Flow optimization, time awareness | Focus tracking |

**Priority**: Phase 2 Intelligence  
**Location**: `projects/qomoboro/` *(to be created)*

**Mission**: Flow state optimization and temporal awareness
- **Focus session tracking** with ecosystem awareness
- **Time wordplay interface** (como/boro = how/steal time)
- **Productivity pattern recognition** across development cycles
- **Flow protection** through intelligent interruption filtering

**Key Innovation**: Time tracking that enhances rather than surveils productivity

## Cross-Project Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
**Priority Projects**: uroboro, doggowoof, wherewasi
- [ ] **Shadow mode IPC**: Basic inter-tool communication
- [ ] **Local data sharing**: SQLite databases and shared protocols
- [ ] **Context integration**: wherewasi enhances other tools
- [ ] **Individual validation**: Each tool works independently and together

### Phase 2: Intelligence Integration (Months 4-6)
**Add**: examinator, qomoboro ecosystem awareness
- [ ] **Feedback loops**: Sentiment ‚Üí monitoring, context ‚Üí communication
- [ ] **Pattern recognition**: Cross-tool learning and optimization
- [ ] **Ecosystem AI**: Emergent intelligence from tool interaction
- [ ] **Professional features**: Team collaboration and business value

### Phase 3: Unified Intelligence (Months 7-12)
**Complete**: Full ecosystem AI capabilities
- [ ] **Natural language queries**: Ask ecosystem about work patterns
- [ ] **Predictive capabilities**: Anticipate productivity needs
- [ ] **Self-optimization**: System learns and improves automatically
- [ ] **Community platform**: Framework others can adopt
