*"Phone home to the world state. Build solutions that matter. Stay focused."*

## Project Status: SOPHISTICATED CONCEPT & EARLY IMPLEMENTATION

### **Current State: Visionary Design with Foundation Code**
- **Go CLI Structure**: Professional command architecture with cobra framework
- **Clear Vision**: Anti-engagement philosophy thoroughly documented
- **Pattern Recognition**: Conceptual framework for RSS → LLM → patterns pipeline
- **Secret Agent Mode**: Self-destructing briefings concept implemented (placeholder)
- **Integration Planning**: Clear ecosystem intelligence integration roadmap
- **North Star Discipline**: Focus guardrails established to prevent scope creep

### **The Revolutionary Approach: Anti-Engagement News**
**Against**: Traditional news platforms that optimize for clicks, scrolling, time-on-site  
**For**: Osmotic absorption that provides awareness and returns focus to building  
**Innovation**: First news tool designed to actively fight engagement addiction

## Core Philosophy & Anti-Engagement Mission

### **The Fundamental Problem Solved**
**"How do you stay aware of world patterns without getting trapped in the engagement machine?"**

**The Builder's Dilemma**:
- Need world awareness to build meaningful solutions
- News consumption undermines focus needed to build those solutions
- Current platforms optimize for engagement, not awareness
- Information overload prevents pattern recognition

### **The Osmotic Solution**
**"Absorb patterns, not noise. Know the world state, stay focused on building."**

**Core Principles**:
- **Pull-based awareness**: No feeds, no notifications, no algorithms
- **Pattern recognition over event reporting**: "Conflicts continue in [region]" vs "Latest explosion kills 3"
- **Local processing**: Your awareness patterns stay completely private
- **Anti-engagement architecture**: Purely informational, zero dopamine hooks
- **30-second test**: Get world awareness and return to focused work

### **The Osmosis Metaphor**
**Biological inspiration**: Cells absorb nutrients without active consumption effort  
**Information application**: Absorb world patterns without active engagement effort  
**Result**: World awareness becomes background intelligence, not foreground distraction

## Technical Architecture: Intelligence Without Addiction

### **Anti-Engagement Design Patterns**
```
Osmotic Intelligence Pipeline:
├── RSS Aggregation (diverse global sources)
├── Local LLM Pattern Extraction (private processing)
├── Multi-day Accumulation (SQLite time-series)
├── Confidence Scoring (source diversity weighting)
├── Pull-based Interface (CLI only, no feeds)
└── Self-destruct Features (prevent prolonged engagement)
```

### **Revolutionary User Experience Design**
**Commands optimized for rapid awareness**:
```bash
# 30-second world state check
osmotic status

# Self-destructing briefing (auto-closes after 30s)
osmotic status --secret-agent

# Optional lockout after briefing
osmotic status --secret-agent --lockout=10m

# Focused deep dive (2 minutes maximum)
osmotic deep --region=asia --topic=economy
```

### **Local-First Privacy Architecture**
**100% local processing**:
- **RSS aggregation**: Direct source pulling without cloud APIs
- **Pattern extraction**: Local LLM (Ollama) analysis
- **SQLite storage**: Time-series pattern database
- **Zero telemetry**: No external data transmission ever
- **Offline capable**: Cached patterns work without internet

### **Anti-Addiction Technology**
**Technical features that prevent engagement**:
- **No personalization**: Same patterns for everyone (no filter bubbles)
- **No recommendations**: Pure information, no algorithmic suggestions
- **No feeds**: Completely pull-based interaction model
- **No notifications**: Check when YOU want to know
- **Self-destruct briefings**: Secret agent mode auto-closes after 30 seconds
- **Optional lockout**: Prevent tool access for specified duration

## Current Implementation & Working Features
