## Strategic Architecture Overview

### The Square Peg Philosophy
**Core Identity**: Creating better systems instead of conforming to broken ones  
**Mission**: Building tools that teach you to build better tools  
**Method**: Psychology-informed systematic design with local-first privacy

### The Intelligence Trinity
**Scout** (wherewasi) → **Scribe** (uroboro) → **Scholar** (examinator)  
*Context gathering → Professional communication → Knowledge curation*
