# QRY Labs AI Disclaimer Rollout Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of AI disclosures across QRY Labs' three projects (uroboro, wherewasi, doggowoof) to address legal compliance, ethical transparency, and community trust requirements.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1-2)
- [ ] **README Updates**: Add AI disclosure sections to all three project READMEs
- [ ] **LICENSE Reviews**: Audit current licenses for AI compatibility
- [ ] **Contribution Guidelines**: Update CONTRIBUTING.md files with AI policies

### Phase 2: Short-term (Week 3-4)
- [ ] **Code Comments**: Add AI generation markers to relevant code sections
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**: Update technical docs with AI methodology
- [ ] **Release Notes**: Add AI usage notes to existing releases

### Phase 3: Ongoing (Month 2+)
- [ ] **Automated Tooling**: Implement AI disclosure automation
- [ ] **Legal Review**: Quarterly legal compliance audits
- [ ] **Community Feedback**: Monitor and respond to disclosure concerns

## Project-Specific Recommendations

### Uroboro (Internal Development Communication)
**Risk Level**: LOW-MEDIUM - Operational content (LOW) + Optional storytelling features (MEDIUM)

**Required Disclosures**:
- AI assistance in operational content generation (patch notes, handovers, standup bullets)
- Enhanced disclosure for storytelling features
- User choice between operational and creative modes
- Clear differentiation between factual and narrative content

**Suggested README Section (Tiered Approach)**:
```markdown
## AI Disclosure - Tiered by Risk Level

### Operational Content (Patch Notes, Handovers, Standup Bullets)
Uroboro generates factual summaries of your development work. All content is based on 
your actual commits, code changes, and project activity. Review generated content for 
accuracy before sharing.

### Storytelling Features (Optional)
⚠️ CREATIVE CONTENT NOTICE: Story generation features use AI trained on diverse text 
sources. Generated narratives may reflect training patterns and should be reviewed for 
originality. Consider human editing before external use.
```

### Wherewasi (AI Context Generation CLI)
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM - Direct AI integration but primarily metadata generation

**Required Disclosures**:
- AI model dependencies and versions
- Data processing and privacy implications
- Context generation methodology
- Local-first privacy protections

**Suggested README Section**:
```markdown
## AI & Privacy
Wherewasi uses AI for context generation while maintaining local-first privacy. No code 
is transmitted to external services. AI processing occurs locally with clearly defined 
model boundaries.
```

### Doggowoof (Alert Monitoring System)
**Risk Level**: LOW - Minimal AI integration, primarily rule-based

**Required Disclosures**:
- AI-assisted alert categorization (if applicable)
- Data retention and processing policies
- Webhook content handling

## Legal Compliance Framework

### 1. Intellectual Property Protection
- **Action**: Implement code origin tracking
- **Timeline**: Phase 1
- **Responsibility**: Development team
- **Deliverable**: Origin metadata in all files

### 2. License Compatibility Audit
- **Action**: Review all dependencies for AI compatibility
- **Timeline**: Phase 1
- **Responsibility**: Legal/Development
- **Deliverable**: Compatibility matrix document

### 3. User Consent and Transparency
- **Action**: Clear disclosure of AI capabilities and limitations
- **Timeline**: Phase 1
- **Responsibility**: Product/Legal
- **Deliverable**: Updated user documentation

## Recommended Disclaimer Templates

### Standard AI Disclosure (All Projects)
```markdown
## AI Assistance Disclosure
This project was developed with assistance from AI tools including but not limited to:
- Code generation and completion
- Documentation writing and editing
- Testing and debugging assistance

All AI-generated content has been reviewed and validated by human developers. Users 
should independently verify any code or documentation before production use.
```

### Enhanced Disclosure (High-Risk Projects)
```markdown
## AI and Intellectual Property Notice
This software incorporates AI-generated code and content. While efforts have been made 
to ensure originality, users should:
- Conduct independent IP clearance for commercial use
- Review all generated content for accuracy and compliance
- Understand that AI outputs may inadvertently reflect training data patterns

The maintainers make no warranties regarding the originality or fitness of 
AI-generated components.
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] README.md AI disclosure sections
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md AI contribution guidelines
- [ ] LICENSE compatibility review
- [ ] Code comment AI markers
- [ ] Release note AI usage summaries

### Technical Implementation
- [ ] Git commit message AI tags
- [ ] Code generation tracking metadata
- [ ] Automated disclosure insertion tools
- [ ] CI/CD compliance checks

### Legal Compliance
- [ ] Terms of service AI clauses
- [ ] Privacy policy AI processing sections
- [ ] User agreement AI disclosure requirements
- [ ] Liability limitation clauses

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High Priority
1. **Immediate README Updates**: Prevent current liability exposure
2. **License Audit**: Ensure current compliance
3. **Code Review Process**: Implement AI-aware review protocols

### Medium Priority
1. **Automated Tooling**: Reduce manual disclosure burden
2. **Training Programs**: Educate team on AI legal implications
3. **Community Engagement**: Proactive transparency communication

### Low Priority
1. **Industry Monitoring**: Track evolving legal landscape
2. **Insurance Review**: Assess coverage for AI-related risks
3. **Patent Clearance**: Proactive patent conflict prevention

## Success Metrics

### Compliance Metrics
- 100% of public repositories include AI disclosures
- Zero legal compliance violations
- All team members trained on AI disclosure requirements

### Community Metrics
- Positive community feedback on transparency
- Reduced legal inquiry volume
- Increased contributor confidence

## Quarterly Review Process

### Legal Compliance Review
- Audit disclosure accuracy and completeness
- Review emerging legal requirements
- Update templates and guidelines

### Technical Implementation Review
- Assess automation tool effectiveness
- Review code generation tracking accuracy
- Update technical documentation

### Community Feedback Integration
- Analyze user concerns and suggestions
- Implement disclosure improvements
- Communicate changes transparently

## Contact and Escalation

### Internal Escalation Path
1. **Development Team**: Day-to-day implementation
2. **Product Management**: Policy decisions
3. **Legal Counsel**: Compliance and risk assessment

### External Resources
- Legal counsel for complex IP questions
- Industry groups for best practice sharing
- Open source community for feedback
