*"First developer tool company with actual psychology research backing"*

## The Psychology Collaboration Breakthrough

### Strategic Positioning Shift
**From**: Tech-bro "ship fast break things" approach  
**To**: **"Working WITH human psychology"** systematic methodology

### The Academic Credibility Advantage
**Wife's Masters in Psychology** = immediate academic legitimacy for UX claims and design decisions. This transforms QRY Labs from intuition-based tool development to research-backed systematic design.

### Market Differentiation Opportunity
**Traditional Developer Tools**: Built on developer intuition, "power user" optimization, feature-heavy complexity, ignore cognitive psychology  
**QRY Labs Approach**: Psychology-research backed, executive dysfunction aware, friction-reduction focused, human-centered systematic design

## Core Research Framework

### Psychology-Informed Design Principles

#### 1. Cognitive Load Theory Applied to CLI Design
**Research Area**: How command-line interfaces can reduce rather than increase cognitive overhead

**Key Questions**:
- What makes certain command patterns intuitive vs overwhelming?
- How can systematic workflows support rather than burden working memory?
- What role does muscle memory play in CLI efficiency?
- How do modal interfaces (vim) relate to cognitive state management?

**QRY Tool Applications**:
- **wherewasi**: Context generation reduces cognitive switching costs
- **uroboro**: "No Excuses" capture minimizes cognitive overhead of documentation
- **qomoboro**: Time awareness without time policing
- **doggowoof**: Intelligent filtering reduces alert fatigue

#### 2. Executive Dysfunction and Productivity Software
**Research Area**: Building tools that work WITH rather than against executive dysfunction patterns

**Key Questions**:
- Why do traditional productivity tools fail for neurodivergent users?
- How can systematic approaches support rather than overwhelm executive function?
- What design patterns reduce friction for task initiation and completion?
- How can tools provide structure without feeling restrictive?

**Design Applications**:
- **Friction-free capture**: uroboro's immediate insight recording
- **Context preservation**: wherewasi eliminates "where was I?" overhead
- **Gentle monitoring**: doggowoof as helpful companion, not surveillance
- **Modal simplicity**: Clear, distinct tool functions vs feature bloat

#### 3. Flow State Optimization in Developer Tools
**Research Area**: How systematic tools can support and protect flow states

**Key Questions**:
- What environmental factors support sustained focus for developers?
- How do interruptions and context switches affect cognitive performance?
- What role does tool predictability play in maintaining flow?
- How can tools provide necessary information without breaking concentration?

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Predictable interfaces**: Consistent interaction patterns across tools
- **Shadow mode operation**: Intelligence without active interruption
- **Context preservation**: Seamless project switching support
- **Intelligent filtering**: Only surface truly important information
