*"Performance + Learning + Systematic Control = Better understanding of what makes tools engaging and effective."*

## Strategic Evolution Path

**Current State** → **Zed Bridge** → **Final CLI Ecosystem**
```
Cursor (GUI, slow) → Zed (Rust, fast, keyboard-first) → aider/neovim/zellij (CLI mastery)
```

## Phase 1: Cursor Assessment & Problems Identified

### Current Pain Points
- **Performance Issues**: Memory leaks and lag during intensive development
- **Context Switching**: Mouse-heavy workflows breaking flow state
- **Limited Customization**: IDE constraints vs systematic workflow needs
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Proprietary AI integration limiting flexibility

### What Works Well
- AI-assisted development capabilities
- Integrated terminal experience
- Project-wide search and navigation
- Git integration workflows

### Strategic Decision
**Keep Cursor operational** while systematically building CLI skills. No bridge burning - tools serve the mission, not ego.

## Phase 2: Zed Bridge Strategy (Current Focus)

### Why Zed is the Perfect Intermediate Step

#### Performance Alignment
- **Rust-based architecture** matches technical preferences
- **Immediate performance gains** over Cursor's lag issues
- **Modern LSP integration** without configuration complexity
- **Native speed** that enables flow state maintenance

#### Learning Bridge Benefits
- **Keyboard-first habits** that transfer to final CLI setup
- **Less overwhelming** than jumping directly to neovim
- **Modal editing introduction** via vim mode
- **Terminal integration** practice for CLI workflows

#### Skill Transfer Matrix
```
Zed Skill → Final Setup Transfer
├── File jumping (Cmd+P) → Telescope in neovim
├── Keyboard shortcuts → Custom keybindings
├── Terminal comfort → Zellij navigation
├── Multi-pane thinking → Terminal multiplexing
├── Search patterns → ripgrep workflows
└── Git integration → CLI git mastery
```

### Zed Configuration Strategy

#### Transition-Optimized Settings
```json
{
  "vim_mode": true,
  "tab_size": 2,
  "soft_wrap": "editor_width",
  "show_whitespaces": "all",
  "terminal": {
    "shell": "zsh",
    "working_directory": "current_project_directory"
  },
  "project_panel": {
    "dock": "left",
    "default_width": 240
  }
}
```

#### Learning Objectives
- **Week 1-2**: Basic Zed adoption, configure for transition-friendly settings
- **Week 3-4**: Advanced workflows, vim mode practice, heavy terminal usage
- **Week 5+**: Evaluate comfort level and plan final transition

## Phase 3: Final CLI Ecosystem Architecture

### Core Tool Stack

#### Essential Components
- **aider**: AI pair programming in terminal
- **neovim**: Modal editing mastery with lua configuration
- **zellij**: Terminal multiplexing with systematic layouts
- **ripgrep (rg)**: Fast project-wide search
- **fd**: Fast file finding
- **bat**: Syntax-highlighted file viewing
- **eza**: Enhanced directory listing

#### The QRY Development Layout
```
zellij session "qry-dev":
├── nvim pane (70% width) - Main editing
├── aider pane (18% width) - AI collaboration  
└── terminal pane (12% width) - Commands/testing
```

### Neovim Configuration Philosophy

#### Plugin Strategy: Essential Over Extensive
```lua
-- Core navigation (replaces Cursor/Zed file explorer)
'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim'
'ThePrimeagen/harpoon'

-- Code intelligence (LSP + completion)
'neovim/nvim-lspconfig'
'hrsh7th/nvim-cmp'

-- Syntax and Git
'nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter'
'tpope/vim-fugitive'
'lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim'

-- QRY Labs theme
'catppuccin/nvim'
```

#### Keybinding Philosophy: Systematic Muscle Memory
```lua
-- Telescope (fuzzy finding) - replaces Cmd+P
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ff', '<cmd>Telescope find_files<cr>')
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>fg', '<cmd>Telescope live_grep<cr>')

-- Harpoon (quick navigation) - replaces tabs
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>a', require('harpoon.mark').add_file)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<C-e>', require('harpoon.ui').toggle_quick_menu)

-- LSP (code intelligence) - replaces hover/definition
vim.keymap.set('n', 'gd', vim.lsp.buf.definition)
vim.keymap.set('n', 'K', vim.lsp.buf.hover)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>ca', vim.lsp.buf.code_action)
```

### Aider Integration Strategy

#### AI Collaboration Workflow
```bash
# Project-specific aider sessions
aider --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 --git

# File-specific collaboration
aider src/main.py src/utils.py --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

# Context-aware development
aider --read docs/architecture.md --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

#### Integration with QRY Ecosystem
- **wherewasi integration**: Context generation for aider sessions
- **uroboro capture**: AI collaboration insights documented
- **Shadow mode**: Tools communicate development state

## QRY Labs Integration Benefits

### Tool Understanding Through Usage
**Systematic learning approach**: Understanding CLI tool design patterns through daily use informs our own tool development.

#### Design Pattern Analysis
- **Modal interfaces**: Vim's mode system → game state management insights
- **Composition patterns**: Unix philosophy → modular tool architecture
- **Performance optimization**: CLI efficiency → responsive user experience
- **Workflow customization**: Configuration systems → user empowerment

### Educational Content Creation
**"Learning CLI workflows"** becomes educational content for systematic thinking.

#### Content Opportunities
- CLI transition documentation for other developers
- Systematic approach to tool mastery
- Performance vs features analysis
- Workflow optimization as game design

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### Transition Risks

#### Learning Curve Overhead
**Risk**: Time spent learning tools vs building projects
**Mitigation**: Use active QRY projects as learning vehicle - real work drives real learning
