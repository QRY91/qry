# QRY Labs: Stay Curious

*An educational game studio that teaches through systematic analysis and creation*

## Core Vision

**"All games are educational - that's literally what they're for."**

QRY Labs analyzes what makes games work, shares that knowledge through systematic tools, and creates games that teach others the rationale behind good design.

## The Philosophy

### Games = Software Design
**If it exists, it can be analyzed.**
- Every game mechanic teaches something about systems thinking
- Every design decision reveals principles about user experience
- Every successful game demonstrates systematic problem-solving
- Game design IS software design applied to engagement and learning

### The Systematic Approach
**Learn → Analyze → Share → Create → Repeat**

1. **Dig through game library** (600+ games of research material)
2. **Delve into mechanics** using systematic analysis
3. **Process insights** with our own tools (Uroboro, Examinator, etc.)
4. **Share knowledge** publicly through qryzone
5. **Store and publish** systematic documentation
6. **Create games** based on learned principles
7. **Learn more** from the creation process
8. **Share that too** - "and so can you!"

## What We Build

### Educational Games
**Games that teach while being genuinely fun to play**
- Programming concepts through puzzle mechanics

- Creative thinking through constraint-based challenges
- Technical skills through hands-on building experiences

### Analysis Tools
**Systematic approaches to understanding game design**
- Frameworks for analyzing game mechanics
- Tools for documenting design patterns
- Systematic approaches to learning from existing games
- AI-enhanced analysis and insight generation

### Fantasy Consoles
**Constrained environments that breed creativity**
- Educational game development platforms
- Constraint-driven design environments
- Systematic progression from simple to complex
- Community-driven learning and sharing

### Knowledge Sharing Platform
**Making game design wisdom accessible**
- Systematic documentation of design principles
- Interactive tutorials for game development concepts
- Community for sharing analysis and insights
- Tools that make learning feel like playing

## The QRY Labs Difference

### We Don't Just Make Games
**We make the process of understanding games systematic and shareable**

### We Don't Just Teach
**We create environments where learning happens naturally through play**

### We Don't Just Analyze
**We build tools that enable others to analyze and create systematically**

### We Don't Just Code
**We approach software design through the lens of engagement and learning**

## Target Audience

### Primary: Creative Technologists
**People who want to understand the intersection of:**
- Game design and software architecture
- Educational theory and interactive experiences
- Systematic thinking and creative expression
- Technical depth and accessible communication

### Secondary: Game Developers
**Who want to understand the "why" behind design decisions**

### Tertiary: Educators & Students
**Who want engaging ways to learn complex technical concepts**

## Success Metrics

### Educational Impact
- **People learning** through our games and tools
- **Understanding deepened** about systematic design thinking
- **Community growth** around shared learning and creation

### Creative Output
- **Games created** that demonstrate design principles in action
- **Tools built** that enable others to create and analyze
- **Knowledge shared** that helps others understand design rationale

### Systematic Innovation
- **New approaches** to educational game design
- **Novel tools** for game analysis and creation
- **Bridge building** between game design and broader software development
